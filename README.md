# tinysat - An ATTINY13 based circuit sculpture

tinysat is based on a similar project by Mohit Bhoite - https://www.bhoite.com/sculptures/tiny-cube-sat

tinysat is comprised of an ATTINY13 blinker circuit, powered by a large capacitor and charged by a pair of solar panels. 
The device is nocturnal, and uses the solar panels as a light sensor to detect when it is in darkenss, and then it will begin to blink.
